# Project Management Documentation

## Team Structure
We decided to organize ourselves into a group of five because we knew each other and already had experience working together. One of the first decisions we made was how to divide the workload between us. This was difficult because there were a few roles that almost everyone wanted to take on. In the end, we agreed and the roles were distributed as follows:

|Person |Role |
|--- |--- |
|Abdulloh |Git Master; Level Designer |
|Koustav |Lead Developer |
|Liza |Game Designer |
|Juanita |Graphic Designer |
|Aanjneya |Test and Defect Management |

Abdulloh already has experience with Git and was therefore the qualified candidate for the role. He also has an interest in level design. As the lead developer, Koustav was the main programmer we could trust. With her bright ideas and creative mindset, Liza was the perfect solution for us. Juanita is known for her artistry, and we couldn't have found a better person. If you're looking for critical thinking and problem-solving, you have to find Aanjneya. That's what we did; he was the go-to person when a problem arose. There was no fixed role, but everyone worked together and truly acted as a team, which we're proud of.

## Schedule and Milestones

At the beginning, there were not only plans, but also enthusiasm for the project. Therefore, we planned a lot. We were supposed to have three to four levels and an AI NPC as the final boss. By the first milestone, we already knew what we were going to do. But we hadn't started programming the game yet. By the second milestone, we already had a prototype, and only then did we understand what was possible and what wasn't. Having an NPC as the final boss was no longer realistic, and we moved on to the Dark Night as a final challenge.

## Communication

All communication with each other took place via WhatsApp. A group was created to work as a team.
Issues were also shared via GitLab. We wrote to-dos on WhatsApp and assigned one person responsibility for each item.
Meetings were held every day in the cafeteria, as we always sit together. But special meetings also took place almost every week, staying at the TU after Stk.
A variety of devices were available. From MacBooks to Windows laptops to iPads, everything was used and needed.

## Challenges

As a group of five, there were many organizational challenges, which began with the decision to play the game. Different opinions
were expressed, but it was easy to deal with such problems because our strong friendship enabled us to compromise. It was therefore much easier over time
to make decisions. Our savior was a coin, which I still carry with me, a few times when we couldn't reach an agreement.

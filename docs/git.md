# **Git Documentation**

This is written by Git master Abdulloh Khakimov.

## **Repository Structure**

Our Git repository has a simple and clear structure. The main components are:

.idea/                → Project configuration files (generated by IDE)  
    assets/               → Images, music, and other media resources  
    docs/                 → Documentation and presentation materials  
    map/                  → Map files and level information  
    Ski_Shakira_main.py   → Main game file with game logic  
    requirements.txt      → List of required Python libraries  
We did not use a classic branch strategy. Instead, each team member made changes locally by creating a copy of the file and working on it. At the end of the project, all changes were merged, unnecessary copies were removed, and the final main file (Ski_Shakira_main.py) was left in the repository.

## **Workflow**

Our team consisted of **five members**, and **all of them actively contributed to the repository**.

We worked with Git mainly via **the terminal using classic Git commands** such as git add, git commit, and git push. We worked directly with the GitLab remote repository.

All team members pushed regularly.

The active development phase lasted from **March 20 to May 16**.

There were a total of **71 commits**, which corresponds to an average of **1.2 commits per day**.

Most of the development took place **together on site in the library**. The distribution of tasks was clearly structured so that everyone was responsible for a specific component of the game. In the event of overlaps or joint work on certain modules, the **final merge result was decided by the person responsible for the relevant part**. Other team members could provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.

## **Statistics**
A total of **71 commits** were made during the project. The contributions of the individual team members were distributed as follows:

|**Name**| **GitLab handle** | **Commits** |**Area of responsibility**|
|--|--|-------------|--|
| Abdulloh Khakimov | @akhakiym | 16          | Git master; level designer |
| Elizaveta Chichkanov | @chiliza | 14          | Game Designer |
| Koustav Agrawal | @koustavagr2005 | 34          | Lead Developer |
| Juanita Giraldo | @juanisg | 3           | Graphic Designer |
| Aanjneya Moudgil| @aanjneya | 12          | Testing and Bug Management |

Although everyone had a specific role, there was a lot of **interdisciplinary collaboration** within the team. At various stages of the project, members supported each other with their knowledge, e.g., when fixing bugs or fine-tuning the level design.

## Best Practices

During the development of our project, we tried to implement as many **Git best practices** as possible:

-   **Meaningful commit messages**: We made sure to write clear and understandable descriptions that summarized the changes well.

-   **Sensible commit frequency**: Instead of committing after every little thing, we tried to commit completed blocks of work.
    
- **Use of .gitignore**: The virtual environment (venv/) was deliberately ignored to keep the repository clean. Instead, we maintained a requirements.txt file.

- **Regular commits and teamwork**: All team members pushed regularly and worked well together.
    
- **Very few conflicts**: Thanks to a clear division of tasks and good communication, there were hardly any merge conflicts.


### **What we would improve in the next project:**

- **Use of a branch strategy**: Working with feature branches would have made collaboration more structured and would be more scalable for larger projects.
    
- **Automated testing and linting**: Simple unit tests or code checks would have helped us detect errors early on.

- **Better documentation during the process**: Ongoing documentation would have helped us with presentation and follow-up.

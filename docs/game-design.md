## Game Design

Here, game designer Elizaveta Chichkanov reports

## Game Concept

The basic concept of our game is survival on a path filled with obstacles. Mechanics such as jumping, turning, and dynamic lighting have been implemented in the game.  In the original prototype, the map and the program were poorly 
linked, and there were also problems with the physics engine settings.

## Story and Characters

The main character is Shakira. She has gone to the mountains to relax and ski. To control the protagonist,
you have to press the space bar to jump or the right arrow key to turn. There are no non-player characters
in the game.

## Game objective and progression

The objective of the game is to cover a certain distance with obstacles. The player must
collect collectibles (coins) or perform tricks (complete spins) to increase their score. In the first level
there are few obstacles, but in the second level the number of obstacles increases. In addition, visibility is limited due to darkness,
which also increases the difficulty.

## Assets and resources

The graphics include homemade maps and obstacles, as well as the AI-generated character Shakira. The music comes
from various websites: pixabay.com, khinsider.com, and youtube.com.
